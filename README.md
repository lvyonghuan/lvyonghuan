I don’t want to be an engineer
I tried so hard and got so far
And now I can’t decide
All my life I’ve given my career
These numbers in my head
keep on spinning round and round yeah
I can only guess
What’s right? Should I stay?
Three more years
Just to waste away
Become a slave to all these numbers
It’s overdue, all this stress
Yet I say I’m fine...


Working overtime
Tryna finish this in time
Got myself into this mess
Can we really pass this test, yeah
XYZ yeah teach me how to breathe
I’m suffocating deep inside
I can’t deny just want to quit
All my life I failed...
To be the one to meet those expectations
All my life I tried...
Now all this stress to fill those answers
ABC finding all these numbers, numbers
Integrate differentiate
It’s getting old, yeah
543
Finding all these numbers, numbers
Calculate, no mistake
It’s getting old, yeah
